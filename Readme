Tools Used;

NPM project:

HTTP request Library: Axios
Assertion Library: Chai
Testin Framework: Mocha

To run tests two ways:
'npm test' or ‘mocha --timeout 10000’ 


Differences between GET and POST

GET: is an HTTP method used to retrieve existing data in the API in a specified format(Json or XML)- 
POST: is an HTTP method that is used to add data to the API.
It usually requires a body or Payload to be added to the request in the specific schema used 
and it allows us to save the new data added 
and should be able to immediately retrieve it/confirm it with the use of GET method.(if added correctly)


Side Note: 

If test fails it is because the usMarketOpen hours of operations change;
So when it is closed, we should change the related statements .tofalse 
And that should fix the problem
